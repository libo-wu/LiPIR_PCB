PCB files related to the LiPIR design

## LC driver board
	This board has three inputs: PWM 1 and PWM 2 from the external MCU; Vdd is from an 9V battery. 
	
	Two outputs: OUT1 and OUT2.
	
	PWM 1 and PWM 2 are PWM waveforms that out-of-phase with the frequency \[f\] around 100Hz. The outpout signal is an alternate current (AC) voltage with amplitute around 18V. 
	
	TO DO:
	
	1. Solder the board and use Arduino board to test the performance.
	2. Measure the power consumption.
